# MostTalked.com Daily Digest Email Template

See the preview here: http://denizozger.github.io/mosttalked.com-newsletter-template/

### Issues and solutions

MailChimp does not allow tweets to be embedded, they recommend taking a screenshot of the tweet and linking it to the actual tweet (https://longreply.com/r/4e15cd67).

If this newsletter gains traction, I'm planning to setup an SMTP server, get all subscribers by MailChimp API, and send them HTML emails via a basic - say Node.js - application.
